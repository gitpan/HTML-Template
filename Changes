Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Template.

0.00  Fri May 14 14:59:06 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.01  Mon May 17 15:17:00 1999
        - added cacheing to module and perldoc
        - moved .tmpl files used by 'make test' to /templates
        - first release!

0.02  Mon May 31 12:47:00 1999
        - die on multiple source parameters in new()
        - tries to preserve newlines in loop body
        - copies in array contents from array refs on param call
          i.e. allows for reuse of scratch arrays on calling side
        - Added a CREDITS section to the docs, inaugurated it with
          Richard Chen for his many fixes.
        - Added type => 'sometype', source => 'source' new() syntax.
        - made "NAME=" in tags optional.  Added a test.pl to check for
          this.

0.03  Fri June 11 17:37:00 1999
        - fixed a few irritating "undefined variable" errors in -w
        - big speedup on large TMPL_LOOPs.  They are at least one order of
          magnitude faster now!
        - die_on_bad_params => 0 never really worked!  It does now.

0.04  Fri June 18 12:00:00 1999
        - fixed cacheing - under certain conditions it was totally broken!
        - changed {param} to {param_values} - some older perls complained.
        - die_on_bad_params => 0 now also applied to loop body.
        - added copious comments about how bad m//i is to avoid future
          bug reports about [tT][hH][iI][sS]!
        - added numerous bug fixes and optimizations submitted by Mike
          Blazer, Adriano Nagelschmidt Rodrigues, Andrej Mikus and
          Ilya Obshadko.  Thanks!

        - small problem with make test fixed.

        - *MASSIVE* speedups in all modes - up to 10x faster!1
        - bug fix : param() wasn't returning names of LOOPs
        - This really is version 0.9 so 1.0 is coming up.  Get those
          bug reports in!
